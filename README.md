Rostock-Redux
=============

3d printer derived from rostock, using parameterized code.

I really like the looks and functionality of the rostock printer, but the code isn't very parametric.  This is my attempt to re-do it well.

Robot is sized for M4 screws and nut traps almost everywhere.

Major Vitamins:
6 each of 6mm x 300mm square carbon fiber tubes for the arms
6 each of 10mm x 1000mm steel rods for the vertical travel.
3 each synchromesh pulleys
6 meters synchromesh (from Standard Drive Products)

Smooth rod offset is 225mm.
